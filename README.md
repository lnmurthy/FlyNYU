# FlyNYU - Online Air Ticket Reservation System

## Team Members: Leisha Murthy, Gabe Lora, Andrew Asseily 

Welcome to FlyNYU, your one-stop solution for online air ticket reservations! 
This project is a culmination of our hard work and dedication for the Intro. To Databases course (CS-UY 3083) at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering

### Project Objective:

The objective of our project is to provide a realistic experience in the design process of a relational database and corresponding applications. We focus on conceptual design, logical design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a relational database. Additionally, we aim to implement an associated web-based application to communicate with the database, facilitating actions such as retrieving information and storing information.

### Project Overview:

For the Fall 2022 semester, our course project revolves around developing an online Air Ticket Reservation System. This system caters to two types of users: Customers and Airline Staff (Administrator). Here's a breakdown of what each user can do:

#### Customers:
- Search for flights (one way or round trip)
- Purchase flight tickets
- View future flight status
- Review past flights

#### Airline Staff (Administrator):
- Add new airplanes
- Create new flights
- Update flight status

In essence, FlyNYU aims to provide a seamless experience for both customers and airline staff, simplifying the air ticket reservation process while demonstrating our understanding of database design and implementation principles. Thank you for joining us on this journey!
